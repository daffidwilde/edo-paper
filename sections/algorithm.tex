\section{The evolutionary algorithm}\label{section:algorithm}

\subsection{Structure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Algorithm statement with components
    \item Discussion on the choice to include custom stopping/dwindling
        conditions, compacting the search space, etc.
    \item Operators and detailed mechanisms to come later.
\end{itemize}

Additional algorithms for the individual creation and operator processes are
given in Section~\ref{subsection:mechanisms}. However, there is no defined
process for how to stop the algorithm or adjust the mutation probability,
\(\mu\). This is deliberate as such conditions are specific to the problem
domain. As such, in the Python implementation, a user may define their stopping
condition or \(\mu\)-adjustment to be any function. Some examples include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item These should be real-world examples used in other EA with references.
    \item Stopping when the difference in the variance of the current and last
        population fitnesses is below some tolerance.
    \item Halving the mutation probability every 100 iterations.
\end{itemize}
