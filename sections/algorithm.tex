        conditions, compacting the search space, etc.
    \item Operators and detailed mechanisms to come later.

The statement of the EDO algorithm is deliberately vague here. This is, in part,
because of the customisable nature of its build but also to lay out its general
structure from a high level perspective. Lower level discussion is provided in
Section~\ref{subsection:mechanisms} where additional algorithms for the
individual creation, evolutionary operator and shrinkage processes are given.

Note that there are no defined processes for how to stop the algorithm or adjust
the mutation probability, \(p_m\). These form two key areas of potential
customisation since such conditions can be specific to the problem domain. With
that, as is detailed in the Python implementation, a user may define their
stopping condition or \(p_m\)-adjustment to be any reasonable function. Some
examples include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item These should be real-world examples used in other EA with references.
    \item Stopping when the difference in the variance of the current and last
        population fitnesses is below some tolerance.
    \item Halving the mutation probability every 100 iterations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Internal mechanisms}\label{subsection:mechanisms}

Below are detailed instructions and discussion around the internal mechanisms of
EDO.\ Each component has an affiliated algorithm statement and accompanying
diagram.

\subsubsection{Individuals}

Evolutionary algorithms operate on succeeding populations of individuals often
coined as ``generations''. Typically, a potential solution would be encoded as a
bit string of a fixed length and treated as a chromosome-like object to be
manipulated directly. In EDO, as the objective is to generate datasets, there is
no encoding or information reduction so that the datasets may be manipulated in
a more meaningful way with the biological operators.

In a sense, a dataset is treated similarly to a classical bit string as the
primary components (loci) of the dataset are considered to be its columns.
