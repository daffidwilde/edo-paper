\section{Numerical examples}\label{section:examples}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \(x^2\) example from the docs is a nice easy one to illustrate
        things
    \item Something stochastic
    \item Make use of the moving parts (linear focus of the mutation space,
        dwindling mutation probability, stopping conditions)
    \item If not the \(k\)-modes initialisation example, then another clustering
        one. Maybe \(k\)-means versus DBSCAN to show DBSCAN works better on
        non-convex clusters.
\end{itemize}
