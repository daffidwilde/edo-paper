\section{Conclusion}

{\color{red}{Rough notes still}}

A caveat to this: one should not assume that the columns are a reliable
representative of the distribution associated with them, or vice versa. This is
particularly true of ``shorter'' datasets with a small number of rows, whereas
confidence in the pair could be given more liberally for ``longer'' datasets
with a larger number of rows. In any case, appropriate methods should be
employed to understand the structure and characteristics of the data produced
before formal conclusions are made.
