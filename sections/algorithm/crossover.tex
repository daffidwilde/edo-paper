\subsection{Crossover}

Crossover is the operation of combining two individuals in order to create at
least one offspring. In EDO, a method known as uniform crossover is
used~\cite{Semenkin2012}. Under this method, a new individual is created by
uniformly sampling each of its
components from a set of two ``parent'' individuals. As can be seen in
Figure~\ref{figure:crossover}, this method has been adapted for the dataset
representation, i.e.\ two parent datasets have their dimensions and then columns
sampled uniformly and without replacement to give a new individual.
