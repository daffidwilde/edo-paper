Dear Editor,

We are writing regarding your email subject: "Decision on your manuscript
APIN-D-19-01616". Firstly, we want to thank the second reviewer whose
suggestions and comments we feel have greatly improved the paper. As is evident
by our revised manuscript and our response, we have fully taken these comments
onboard and we look forward to any further scientific discussion with this
reviewer.

Regarding the first reviewer, we have addressed their comments as best as
possible. We would just like to bring to your attention the quality of their
review:

- They make the following comment regarding the language, "The language needs to
  be revised by native speaker research." As we indicate in our response, we are
  three native English speakers with vast experience of scientific publication;
  two of the authors are editors of journals and have published extensively.
  Furthermore, the fact that the English in this single sentence -- and most of
  the review -- is completely broken raises questions about this reviewer's
  ability to judge the language.

- We question how much of the manuscript the reviewer has read. They make
  numerous assertions regarding claims in the paper that are simply not true.
  For example, "in this paper, as you claimed, benchmark datasets are proposed."
  There is no point in the paper that makes such a claim and this is not at all
  what the paper is about. Note the second reviewer did not raise this.

- The reviewer asked us to expand our literature review and proposed six papers,
  all with a single author in common. These papers were not all related to the
  work. We have, however, tried our best to find some connection to two of them
  and included them in the manuscript. This further emphasises our previous
  point as to whether or not the reviewer has read the paper, and also raises a
  potential ethical question about a reviewer just getting more citations of
  their own work.

Thank you very much for reading this and we look forward to any further comments
or suggestions from the second reviewer.
